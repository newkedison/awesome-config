## Awesome config

####             Author: newk (newkedison AT gmail DOT com)

### Feature:

- Config menu item in a separate file
- Config top bar in a separate file
- Custome widgets:

    - Battery status
    - Network transfer rate
    - CPU usage percent
    - Memory usage percent
    - Current datetime
    - Volume control

### Note:

My OS is Ubuntu 12.04, some command and file path maybe different with other OS

### Philosophy 

- Exact value more powerful than progress bar
- Fixed width read more pretty
- As short as possible, but clear is more important
